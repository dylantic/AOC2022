# Dylan does Advent of Code 2022

Thought I'd try my hand at solving AoC 2022 using Go. The language definitely has some quirks but overall it's pretty fun to work with.

New days unlock at 6AM in my timezone and I do have a full-time job, so you won't see me on the leaderboards :)

## Running the code for each day
I assume most AoC stuff can be done using standard libraries, otherwise you can `go get` at the top directory and that should get all dependencies.
You can just run the code for each day with `go run main.go` in any of the day directories.
